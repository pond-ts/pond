## Tasks

### [PND-LIVFIX] — Live robustness P1 cluster

**The standing live-correctness P1** (tasks #98/#99/#114) — the one piece of
non-speculative core debt from the 2026-06 audits, empirically reproduced
(confirmed wrong-answer behavior, not optimization):

- Listener error isolation (a throw skips retention entirely; a derived
  `filter()` view desyncs permanently).
- Re-entrancy (3 failures incl. the `[object Object]` error at
  `live-view.ts:704`).
- Unbounded partitions (push-driven `maxAge` never evicts quiet keys;
  `maxPartitions` silently ignored).
- Chained dispose (`live.filter().map()` orphans the intermediate;
  `dispose()` has no JSDoc).
- Travels with the **reorder+retention windowed-extrema bug**: `LiveReduce`
  over a `reorder` source with retention returns stale/`undefined` for
  `min`/`max`/`first`/`last`/`samples` (their state assumes oldest-arrived
  eviction). Fix: removal-by-value structure selected only for reorder
  sources. Documented in `LiveReduce` JSDoc; workaround
  `live.toTimeSeries().reduce(...)`.

### [PND-LATE] — Late-event propagation through live transforms

A late event accepted at ingest does not re-flow through downstream stateful
transforms (`LiveRollingAggregation` windows, `LiveView.window()` eviction,
no "this was late" payload for subscribers). Needs a discriminated event
payload (`{ event, position: 'append' | number }`) and a recompute path per
stateful transform — overlaps with streaming Milestone A
([PND-CHANGE](PND_STREAMING_PLAN.md)). Archive has the full scope note and
test matrix.

### [PND-LJOIN] — Live merge / join

No way to combine multiple `LiveSeries` into one live source (interleave
same-schema; join cross-schema by time proximity). Open design: subscription
fan-in cadence, time alignment (tolerance window vs carry-forward vs required
`align()`), schema conflict (reuse batch `onConflict`), late-event
interaction. Workaround (documented): snapshot each source + batch `join()`.

### [PND-LALIGN] — Live align + materialize

Bounded-lag streaming `align` (and its sibling `materialize`) — needs a point
forward of each grid boundary, not history, so it's a lag problem, not a
structural gap. Driver: multi-stream joining (network counters,
`throughput = in − out`), which pondjs supported in production. Earns its
slot when a use-case agent hits the snapshot-then-batch friction concretely
or [PND-LJOIN] starts and needs it as a prerequisite.

### [PND-LDEDUP] — Live dedupe

The batch `dedupe({ keep })` shape is the convergence target. Open questions:
update-vs-emit on duplicate arrival, folding into the grace window
(likely: apply `keep` policy at grace close), a `'duplicate'` subscriber
event, interaction with closed aggregation buckets.

### [PND-BUFWIN] — Buffer-as-window Tier 1 + Tier 3

Tier 2 (query parity: `find`/`bisect`/`atOrBefore`/… ) shipped v0.16.0.
Remaining Tier 1: **`live.reduce(mapping)` sugar** (the `'buffer'` sentinel is
in the type but throws at runtime — design it as fused-rolling-with-one-entry),
`live.timeRange()`, `live.eventRate()` on `LiveSeries`, the
`count()`-vs-`length` naming decision. Tier 3 (range-slicing parity +
`window`-vs-`tail` naming) waits until Tier 1 usage shapes it.

### [PND-TRIG] — Trigger taxonomy expansion

From the post-v0.13.2 triage: **`Trigger.any(...)`** composition (mechanical
once singletons exist; reset semantics sketched in the archive) and the
**`Trigger.idle(duration)` RFC moment** — wall-clock by definition, which
commits pond to `setTimeout`, fake-timer test infra, and the
`Trigger.clock` → `eventClock`/`wallClock` naming reshuffle. Lean yes but
gate on a second user signal. Declined: `Trigger.threshold` (it's a filter),
`Trigger.manual` (it's `rolling.emit()` if ever needed).

### [PND-RESV] — Live-side reservoir sampling

Deferred from v0.17.0: Algorithm R's random-slot replacement produces
non-prefix evictions, which the current prefix-only eviction protocol can't
carry (Codex caught the silent-corruption path on PR #129). Gated on the
`LiveChange` exact-removal channel ([PND-CHANGE]). The Option-A
drift-on-eviction design is preserved in the archive; snapshot-side reservoir
already shipped.

### [PND-TAPOBS] — `tap()` per-partition observer

Pending evaluation (gRPC RFC #20): a per-partition observer callback for
slim observation (per-host gauges, debug instrumentation) without reducer
state. Re-triage now that fused rolling shipped — may be a small bolt-on on
the shared dispatch path; may earn its own RFC. Don't pre-decide.

## Parking lot

- Reducer batching (`addMany`) — deferred per the V4 bench; revisit only if a
  consumer is ceiling-bound (production target has 2.5× headroom).
- Shared lower-order moments for paired `avg`+`stdev` — measure first.
- `samples(n)` parameterized reservoir form; reducer composition/chaining
  (`avg.of(samples(20))`) — custom-function reducers cover both today.
- `Trigger.clock` naming wrinkle — held until a second signal or a wall-clock
  trigger forces the umbrella naming.
- Live equivalents of array-column operators.
